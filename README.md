Coders Assemble is a fullstack web application that allows software engineers 
to come together and post thier ideas for projects they want to build in order
to find fellow engineers to collaborate on these projects with them. Users can 
post their own project ideas or look through the projects that others have 
posted. Users can then request to join the team for projects they are 
interested in or can save that project to their favorites. Users can also 
utilize different search features to find projects that are best suited to 
their experience level or technologies they are familiar with. On the Team Page, 
users can see the profile information of their fellow team members and can chat 
with them. This website was intended to create a space where engineers can go 
to find inspiriation, make connections, and begin building incredible 
projects together.
